<p>Every time I move for an extended time to a new city, I am faced with the challenge of choosing between different transportation systems. Should I buy a car, a yearly bus or subway pass, or simply use my bike? It would be useful if I had access to a service (for example through the website of a municipality), that based on my personal travel schedule would rank all the different options based on various factors over the coming years. Such a service could potentially be useful to municipalities interested in achieving a greener society and raise resident awareness on alternative options. </p>

<p>I aim to make an app that compares different transportation methods (such as personal vehicle and public transport) based on factors such as the predicted financial costs, travel duration, pollution index, etc. over the next few years. In the case of personal vehicles, a prototype of this app can make use taxi data to estimate these quantities. This data is useful because the cost and travel duration of vehicle transport depend on many factors such as: the home address of the user, the main destinations traveled to each day, the traffic at times of travel and so on. The taxi data contains a lot of information including travel duration and distance between any two given points in the city at different times of the day over the whole year. This data would inherently contain information about variations in traffic through any day of the year and would implicitly give the associated costs. For my proposal, I use data from the New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission (NYCT&amp;L). It covers four years of taxi operations in New York City and includes about 700 million trips. In addition to helping its users choose the optimal transportation method, this app may help governments gauge the costs and benefits of their public transport systems.</p>
