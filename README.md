# Data Incubator Project Proposal

I am proposing an app that would rank various transportation systems in a city, based on various factors, such as cost, travel time and pollution index. An ideal place for this app, would be the webpage of a municipality, helping each resident of the city to choose the transportation system that suits them best , based on their priorities (money, time or environmental friendliness). Ideally, this information will be gathered based on past data and extrapolated to the future so that the app can predict these factors for a few coming years. 

The input going into the program would be the personalized travel schedule of the user. More precisely, the GPS location of their residence and the GPS locations of a few destinations they travel to on a regular basis. 

For the current proposal, I would like to show how data on Taxis can be analyzed with the goal of predicting the time of travel with vehicle between any two points in New York city (Manhattan). 

## The Data
